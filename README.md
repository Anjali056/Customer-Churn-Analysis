# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer Churn Prediction Using R and Machine Learning Algos
The rapid development of the market in every sector has resulted in service providers having a 
larger subscriber base. Customer acquisition costs are rising as a result of new rivals, fresh and 
inventive business strategies, and improved offerings. Service providers have grasped the need 
of maintaining on-hand consumers in such a quick setup. It is consequently critical for service 
providers to avoid churn, a phenomenon in which a client seeks to leave a company's service.
Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large 
companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom 
field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. 
Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions 
to reduce this churn. The main contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model 
which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn.
